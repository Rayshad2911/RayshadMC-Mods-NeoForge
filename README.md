=======

This is my first own mod, RayshadMC Mod. I'm feeling happy that I'm able to complete this mod.

Why do you want to create a mod?
=======
Idk... At first, I create a datapack. But I scrolled about tutorial, and I found a channel that has tutorial to create
a mod from scratch. Well, just watch the tutorial and done.  
And the real purpose of creating this mod is just doing random things for me lol...

What does this mod do?
=======
Adding three wood types, new advancements, new blocks, and many more. Maybe you will see a new things while you
play this mod.
